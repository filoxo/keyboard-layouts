## Iris layout

Custom layout for my Iris keyboard. Focused for programming on a Mac.

### Usage

1. Copy `macmap` and its contents into `qmk_firmware/keyboards/orthodox/keymaps`

2. From the qmk root, compile keymap and flash automatically by running:

     make orthodox/rev1:macmap:avrdude

### Keymap
